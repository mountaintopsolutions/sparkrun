"""``sparkrun.api.status`` — inspect running workloads via the resolved Executor.

The status surface routes through the *same* executor resolution chain
the launcher uses (CLI > recipe > cluster > runtime > SparkrunConfig),
so the inspector matches the launcher: whatever would have run a
workload is what's asked about it.
